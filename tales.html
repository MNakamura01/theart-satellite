        <p>My room was all dark as I listened to the insistent noise of the monitor that had been my faithful companion since I entered this room. The doctors said that the monitor marked the music that was playing inside me, and maybe that's why I ended up liking the device, and my parents told me, through the magic screen, that was the most beautiful song they had ever heard, but their red faces told me something else.
  Mom was worried about me, but I left her peaceful when I told her that the superheroes were taking care of me. She was confused at first, but then I explained my so precious discovery, that I had seen the doctors who were taking care of me putting on their special clothes that only a hero could wear and also the mark on their faces caused by the masks. I made a drawing for them and said I would keep the secret of their secret identities.
  The heroes also told me that I would be fine soon and dad promised me that we would go to the park and that he would buy lots of ice cream of my favorite flavor. I asked him if grandpa was going too, but dad said grandpa was now in heaven. Did he find out if the moon was really made of cheese, as he told me on the nights we watched the stars?
  I haven't seen the sunlight for days, I miss feeling the heat and going to the beach, sometimes I close my eyes and pretend that the light from the lamp is actually the sun and that my sister is once again covering me with the sand. I can even hear her and my parents laugh in the background and taste salty on my tongue for having swallowed almost a liter of seawater.
  And then the noise of the monitor stops with the music, making a very long and high final note. I open my eyes to see that the room was once again bright and that my heroes were entering the room quickly, but I no longer heard what they were saying or felt pain, in fact I was feeling lighter than ever. And then I saw my grandfather standing next to me wearing an astronaut suit while he extends his hand to me, which I took without hesitation, jumping out of bed and smiling.
  We start to fly upwards, while a smile is plastered on our faces. I close my eyes once again and I can imagine myself on the beach swimming in the sea with my family. And then I look over my shoulders, seeing the Earth behind me that was slowly losing its colors while I made a promise to see my family again.
  I turn my face forward, facing the universe in front of me, gaining ever stronger colors. I didn't have time to be sad, I had a whole universe ahead of me to discover and adventures to live. My journey was not over yet.
  And with that, I let myself be carried away by the lightness of the universe along with my grandfather, prepared for the new adventures that awaited us and with a smile on our faces.</p>
